Variant is a project I wished existed. I've come to love TypeScript, but find it's discriminated unions implementation elegant in some ways and clunky in others. See [motivation](motivation) for some of the problems this addresses.

## The Author

I'm Paarth. I've done a little of everything. I started using TypeScript in... 2015? 2014? I know I remember watching TypeScript get many of its major features and with each release it captured more of my time and attention. My favorite languages pre-TypeScript were OCaml and C#. I adored the expressivity of OCaml but was frustrated by its lack of a platform. As TypeScript introduced more expressive type features it gave me more of what I wanted from a statically typed functional language like OCaml but on the largest platform in the world. *Yes, please*. This project is my attempt at addressing one of the few major holes remaining.
