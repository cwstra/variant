title: Elevator Pitch
---

Variant is a small (`3kB` gzipped) library that can dramatically reorganize your codebase for code clarity, safety, and expressivity.

 - Use variant to quickly define discriminated unions (a.k.a. discriminated unions or algebraic data types).
 - Use `match()`/`matcher()` to process these variants in a type-safe expressions with improved developer experience.
    - Being **exhaustive** by default, these functions ensure all cases are handled, but have support for partial and multi-matching as well.
