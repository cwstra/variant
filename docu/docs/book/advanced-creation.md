## Variants are templates

The `variant()` function accepts a template as an object. In this object each value is a function (ignore `{}` for now). Well... variants count. It is possible to clone `Animal`

```ts
const OtherAnimal = variant(Animal);
```

## Constraining Subtypes

Use `patterned()` and `constrained()` to enforce that every member of a variant meet certain criteria.
