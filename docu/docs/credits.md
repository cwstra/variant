I could not have built this so cleanly or quickly myself. I owe thanks to several projects.

This page is built with [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). Much of the internet owes thanks to the work you do.

The code samples are made magic by [Shiki Twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/).

The api documentation has been scraped and formatted by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) and the community plugin for docusaurus.

The beautiful blurb images on the front page are thanks to [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/). More specific attributions follow:
