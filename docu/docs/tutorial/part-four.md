title: Part 4 - Making Enemies
---

This section we will:

- Create Supervillains.

    - Villains will act as complicating forces. To counter a villain, you need a hero with the same power. 

- (possibly) add villain-exclusive powers (power cancelling, mind control)
    - (extra possibly) let you recruit them.
