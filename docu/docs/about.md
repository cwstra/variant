Variant is a project I wished existed. I love TypeScript, but I find it's discriminated unions implementation elegant in some ways and clunky in others. See the [motivation page](motivation) for some of the problems this library addresses.

## üìú The Author 

I'm Paarth. I've done a little of everything. I started using TypeScript in... 2015? 2014? I know I remember watching TypeScript get many of its major features and with each release it captured more of my time and attention. My favorite languages pre-TypeScript were OCaml and C#. I adored the expressivity of OCaml but was frustrated by its lack of a platform. As TypeScript introduced more expressive type features it gave me more of what I wanted from a statically typed functional language like OCaml but on the largest platform in the world. *Yes, please*. This project is my attempt at addressing one of the few major holes remaining.

I use `variant` in almost every project I make. It's a language feature as a library. I'm lucky enough to get to use it in my professional projects as well. 

I'd like to express my sincere thanks to the users and companies using `variant` in their codebases every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
