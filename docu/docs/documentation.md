Variant makes every effort to preserve documentation and user comments as it transforms
the template to the final variant. Please document your models to create the experience
*you* would desire as a developer. 


```ts
export const Animal {
    /**
     * A four-legged furry animal that ranges in size and activity level.
     **/
    dog: {},
}
```

### TODO
